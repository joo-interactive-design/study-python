## Blackjack game
This project is to create a blackjack game to apply what I've learned

### Rules/ Mechanics / Requirements
-it's played using cards.
-the goal of the game is to add up your cards to the largest number without going over 21.
-if the card in your hand add up to more than 21, then it's called a bust, meaning lose immediately.
-it doens't matter how much you've gone over 21, as long as it's over 21, then you lose.
-the way that the card are counted is that all the cards from 2 to 10 count as their face value./ but Jack, Queen, and King each count as 10/ Ace can be decided as 1 or 11 depends on what you want.
-if the dealer ends up with smaller than 17(16 or under), they must take another card.
